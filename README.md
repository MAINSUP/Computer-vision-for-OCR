1. Example of docTR usage for text recognition with browser application interface. In order to run "docTR_app.py", run the following command line prompt:
streamlit run "PATH"\docTR_app.py. Browser app interface will allow choosing file from directory or enter file URL. 
Text recognition results will appear in the terminal.

2. Testing library easyOCR on handwritten text recognition performance. Program example is given in the form of Jupyter Notebook "EasyOCR.ipynb" for ease of review.
3. An approach is made to train custom Tensorflow model to perform handwriting text recognition. Handwriting prediction model given in "Hand writing with TF.ipynb" utilizes only small part of training dataset due to computationanal limitations. However, one can train it further for a better performance, as found necessary.
